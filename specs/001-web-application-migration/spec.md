# Feature Specification: Web Application Migration

**Feature Branch**: `001-web-application-migration`
**Created**: 2025-10-17
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "перероби проект під веб застосування"

## Overview

Transform the existing desktop Tkinter-based Supply Chain Management System into a modern web application accessible via web browsers. The system currently manages suppliers, warehouses, components, orders, supplies, and contracts through a desktop GUI. The web version will provide the same functionality through a browser-based interface, enabling remote access, multi-user support, and improved scalability.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Supplier Management via Web Browser (Priority: P1)

Warehouse managers and procurement staff need to view, add, edit, and delete supplier information through a web browser from any location with internet access.

**Why this priority**: Supplier management is the foundation of the supply chain system. Without the ability to manage suppliers, no other operations (orders, supplies, contracts) can function. This represents the core CRUD functionality that validates the web architecture works.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by accessing the web application, logging in, navigating to suppliers section, performing CRUD operations (create new supplier, view list, edit details, delete), and verifying data persistence across browser sessions.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user is logged into the web application, **When** they navigate to the Suppliers section, **Then** they see a list of all suppliers with name, contact info, and status
2. **Given** a user views the supplier list, **When** they click "Add New Supplier" and fill in supplier details (name, contact person, phone, email, address), **Then** the new supplier appears in the list immediately
3. **Given** a user views a supplier record, **When** they click "Edit" and modify supplier information, **Then** changes are saved and reflected across all views
4. **Given** a user selects a supplier, **When** they click "Delete" and confirm, **Then** the supplier is removed from the system (if no active contracts exist)
5. **Given** a user is on any page, **When** they search for a supplier by name or contact, **Then** matching results are displayed within 2 seconds

### User Story 2 - Component and Warehouse Inventory via Web (Priority: P1)

Storekeepers and inventory managers need to view and manage components and warehouse inventory through the web interface, including stock levels, locations, and component specifications.

**Why this priority**: Inventory visibility is critical for daily operations. This story delivers immediate business value by enabling staff to check stock levels remotely without being at a physical desktop. It's independently valuable even without ordering or reporting features.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by logging into the web app, navigating to Components and Warehouses sections, viewing inventory lists, adding/editing component records, checking stock levels, and verifying inventory updates persist.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user accesses the Components section, **When** they view the component list, **Then** they see component name, type, current stock quantity, unit price, and warehouse location
2. **Given** a user views component details, **When** they update stock quantity or price, **Then** changes are immediately reflected in inventory reports
3. **Given** a user accesses the Warehouses section, **When** they view warehouse details, **Then** they see all components stored in that warehouse with quantities
4. **Given** a user needs to find a component, **When** they use search or filter by type/warehouse, **Then** matching components are displayed within 2 seconds
5. **Given** inventory is low for a component, **When** a user views that component, **Then** a visual indicator (color, icon) highlights low stock status

---

### User Story 3 - Order and Supply Management (Priority: P2)

Procurement staff need to create, track, and manage orders and supply deliveries through the web interface, including order status, delivery dates, and contract validation.

**Why this priority**: Order management is the operational core that connects suppliers to inventory. While critical for business operations, it depends on suppliers and components being in place (P1 stories). This can be deployed after P1 to add operational workflow.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating a new order through the web interface, associating it with a supplier and components, tracking order status changes, recording supply deliveries, and verifying inventory updates when supplies are received.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user is in the Orders section, **When** they create a new order selecting supplier, components, quantities, and delivery date, **Then** the order is saved with "Pending" status
2. **Given** an order exists, **When** a user views order details, **Then** they see supplier info, ordered components with quantities, total value, order date, and status
3. **Given** an order is fulfilled, **When** a user records the supply delivery with actual quantities received, **Then** inventory stock levels are automatically updated
4. **Given** a user records a supply, **When** the supply details differ from the contract (quantity, price), **Then** the system displays a warning highlighting discrepancies
5. **Given** a user views the Supplies section, **When** they filter by date range or supplier, **Then** matching supply records are displayed with delivery dates and quantities

---

### User Story 4 - Contract Management and Validation (Priority: P2)

Legal and procurement teams need to manage contracts with suppliers and validate orders/supplies against contract terms through the web interface.

**Why this priority**: Contract validation prevents costly errors but is not blocking for basic operational use. Staff can manually verify contracts initially. This adds compliance and quality control on top of operational workflow.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating a contract through the web interface, associating it with a supplier and components, setting contract terms (prices, quantities, validity dates), then attempting to create orders and verifying contract validation warnings appear when terms are violated.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user is in the Contracts section, **When** they create a new contract specifying supplier, component, agreed price, quantity limits, and validity period, **Then** the contract is saved and associated with the supplier
2. **Given** a contract exists, **When** a user creates an order for that supplier and component, **Then** the system validates order price and quantity against contract terms
3. **Given** a contract has expired, **When** a user attempts to create an order using that contract, **Then** the system displays a warning that the contract is no longer valid
4. **Given** a user records a supply delivery, **When** the received quantity or price differs from the contract, **Then** the system highlights the discrepancy for review
5. **Given** a user views a supplier's contracts, **When** they access the supplier detail page, **Then** all active and expired contracts for that supplier are listed

---

### User Story 5 - Reports and Data Export via Web (Priority: P3)

Management and analysts need to generate reports (supplier performance, inventory status, order history) and export data in PDF and CSV formats directly from the web interface.

**Why this priority**: Reporting provides business intelligence but is not required for daily operations. Users can query data manually initially. This adds analytical capabilities after core operational features are working.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by navigating to the Reports section, selecting a report type (e.g., supplier performance, inventory status), setting date ranges or filters, generating the report view in the browser, and downloading in PDF or CSV format.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user accesses the Reports section, **When** they select "Supplier Performance Report" and specify a date range, **Then** the system displays a table showing each supplier with order count, total value, on-time delivery rate
2. **Given** a report is displayed, **When** the user clicks "Export to PDF", **Then** a PDF file is generated and downloaded with the report data formatted with tables and headers
3. **Given** a report is displayed, **When** the user clicks "Export to CSV", **Then** a CSV file is downloaded containing the report data in spreadsheet format
4. **Given** a user generates an "Inventory Status Report", **When** the report is displayed, **Then** it shows all components with current stock, warehouse location, reorder points, and low-stock alerts
5. **Given** a user needs historical data, **When** they generate an "Order History Report" filtered by supplier or date range, **Then** all matching orders are displayed with status, dates, and values

---

### User Story 6 - Multi-User Authentication and Access Control (Priority: P1)

Multiple users need to securely log into the web application with role-based access (Administrator, Procurement Staff, Storekeeper, Manager) to ensure data security and appropriate permissions.

**Why this priority**: Authentication is foundational for a web application. Without it, the system cannot be deployed securely. All other features depend on having authenticated users with appropriate permissions.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating user accounts with different roles, logging in with each account, attempting to access various features, and verifying that permissions are enforced (e.g., storekeepers can only view inventory, administrators can manage users).

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user navigates to the web application URL, **When** they are not authenticated, **Then** they are redirected to a login page
2. **Given** a user enters valid credentials (username and password), **When** they click "Login", **Then** they are authenticated and redirected to the dashboard with features appropriate to their role
3. **Given** a user enters invalid credentials, **When** they attempt to login, **Then** an error message is displayed and they remain on the login page
4. **Given** a user is logged in with "Storekeeper" role, **When** they attempt to access Supplier or Contract management features, **Then** access is denied with a message indicating insufficient permissions
5. **Given** a user is logged in, **When** they are inactive for 30 minutes, **Then** their session expires and they must log in again
6. **Given** an Administrator is logged in, **When** they access the User Management section, **Then** they can create, edit, and delete user accounts and assign roles

### Edge Cases

- What happens when multiple users simultaneously edit the same supplier or component record? (Conflict resolution strategy needed)
- How does the system handle network connectivity loss during data entry? (Auto-save or warning on connection loss)
- What happens when a user tries to delete a supplier who has active orders or contracts? (Prevent deletion with informative error message)
- How does the system behave when the database is unavailable? (Display maintenance message, queue operations if possible)
- What happens when a user uploads a contract document that is too large? (File size limits with clear error message)
- How does the system handle concurrent supply deliveries updating the same inventory item? (Transaction locking to prevent race conditions)
- What happens when a user's session expires while they're filling out a long form? (Auto-save drafts or warn before session expiry)

- **SC-010**: Authentication prevents unauthorized access with 100% effectiveness (no unauthenticated user can access protected features)

## Assumptions

1. **Infrastructure**: The organization has or can provision web server infrastructure (on-premises or cloud) to host the web application
2. **Network**: Users have reliable internet connectivity during work hours to access the web application
3. **Browser Support**: Users have access to modern web browsers updated within the last 2 years
4. **Database Migration**: The existing SQLite database can be migrated to a client-server database (PostgreSQL, MySQL) or remain as SQLite with appropriate concurrency handling for multi-user access
5. **User Training**: Basic training will be provided to help users transition from desktop to web interface
6. **Data Volume**: Current data volume (suppliers, components, orders) is manageable for web application performance (assuming <10,000 records per entity type initially)
7. **Authentication Source**: User accounts will be managed within the application (not integrated with external LDAP/Active Directory initially)
8. **Default Low Stock Threshold**: If not specified, low stock warnings will trigger when inventory falls below 10 units
9. **Mobile Access**: Primary users will access from desktop computers during initial release; mobile-responsive design is desirable but not mandatory for MVP
10. **Session Duration**: 30-minute inactivity timeout is acceptable for security without significantly impacting user workflow

## Out of Scope

The following are explicitly **not** included in this web application migration:

1. **Mobile Native Apps**: Native iOS or Android applications (web-only interface)
2. **Offline Mode**: The web application requires internet connectivity; offline operation is not supported
3. **Real-Time Collaboration**: Advanced features like live collaborative editing or real-time notifications across users
4. **Advanced Analytics**: Business intelligence dashboards, predictive analytics, or machine learning features beyond existing reports
5. **External Integrations**: Integration with external ERP, accounting, or logistics systems
6. **Barcode/RFID Scanning**: Hardware integration for inventory scanning (manual entry only)
7. **Email Notifications**: Automated email alerts for low stock, order status changes (may be added in future)
8. **Supplier Portal**: Self-service interface for suppliers to view orders or update delivery status
9. **Approval Workflows**: Multi-stage approval processes for orders or contracts
10. **Document Management**: Advanced document storage and versioning for contracts (basic file upload only)

## Dependencies

1. **Existing System**: Full understanding of current Tkinter application's business logic, data models, and validation rules
2. **Database Schema**: Complete documentation of existing SQLite database schema
3. **Test Data**: Representative test data for validating web application functionality
4. **User Roles Definition**: Clear definition of permissions for each user role (Administrator, Procurement Staff, Storekeeper, Manager)
5. **Hosting Environment**: Decision on hosting infrastructure (cloud provider or on-premises server)
6. **Security Requirements**: Organization's security policies for authentication, password complexity, session management
7. **Backup Strategy**: Database backup and recovery procedures for the web environment

## Risks

1. **Performance with SQLite**: SQLite may not handle concurrent writes well in multi-user web scenario; may require migration to PostgreSQL/MySQL
2. **Data Migration Complexity**: Migrating data from desktop SQLite to web-accessible database could introduce errors
3. **User Adoption**: Staff accustomed to desktop application may resist transition to web interface
4. **Session Management**: Complex state management for long-running forms or multi-step workflows
5. **Browser Compatibility**: Variations in browser behavior could cause inconsistent user experience
6. **Network Dependency**: Users cannot work during internet outages (unlike desktop application)
