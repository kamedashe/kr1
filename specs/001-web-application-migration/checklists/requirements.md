# Specification Quality Checklist: Web Application Migration

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-17
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Clarifications Resolved

All clarification questions have been answered:

### 1. Low Stock Threshold (FR-024)
**Decision**: Fixed threshold of 10 units
**Rationale**: Simple to implement and understand. Same threshold applies to all components.

### 2. Mobile Responsiveness (FR-025)
**Decision**: Desktop-only (optimized for 1024px+ screens)
**Rationale**: Faster implementation. Simpler UI design. Good for office-based staff.

## Notes

**Overall Assessment**: âœ… **READY FOR PLANNING**

The specification is complete with:
- 6 prioritized user stories (3 P1, 2 P2, 1 P3)
- 25 functional requirements and 8 non-functional requirements
- 10 measurable success criteria
- Comprehensive edge cases, assumptions, dependencies, and risks
- All clarifications resolved

**Recommendation**: Proceed to `/speckit.plan` to generate the implementation plan with technical design and architecture.
